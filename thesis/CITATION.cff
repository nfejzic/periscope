  Selfie is a project of the Computational Systems Group at
  the Department of Computer Sciences of the University of
  Salzburg in Austria.


  The Selfie Project provides an educational platform for
  teaching undergraduate and graduate students the design
  and implementation of programming languages and runtime
  systems. The focus is on the construction of compilers,
  libraries, operating systems, and even virtual machine
  monitors. The common theme is to identify and resolve
  self-reference in systems code which is seen as the key
  challenge when teaching systems engineering, hence the
  name.
